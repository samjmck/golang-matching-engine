# golang-matching-engine

A very naive and primitive order book and matching system in Golang, as an attempt to improve my Go knowledge and delve deeper into things I never learnt properly such as the module/package system and generics.

I documented this process in 3 blog posts:
1. [Core concepts of a financial exchange â€“ order books, bids, asks, matching](https://samjmck.com/en/blog/financial-exchange-go-part-1/) 
2. [Setting up the Go project, Go modules, order matching logic](https://samjmck.com/en/blog/financial-exchange-go-part-2/)
3. [Implementing a linked list instead of slices](https://samjmck.com/en/blog/financial-exchange-go-part-3/)
